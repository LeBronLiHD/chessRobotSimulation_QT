## A Digital Twin System of Chess Playing (SRTP)

> based on [Qt5.14.2](https://download.qt.io/archive/qt/5.14/5.14.2/), best performance with 1920\*1080 and 60 Hz

- Developed a chess-playing stimulator supported by four logical layers, including Canvas, Basic Operation, Evaluation and Chess Rules, Turn-based System and Decision-Making, through Qt Creator
- Integrated several user interfaces for visualization, as well as the software framework of the entire SRTP
- Adopted C++, QML, and structures like Qt Quick, Qt Widgets, Qt Core, and Qt Core Gui
- Demos for the entire SRTP, which included 3 studies, with the [alphacc_zero](https://github.com/lebronlihd/alphacc_zero), and [chess_vision](https://github.com/lebronlihd/chess_vision).
